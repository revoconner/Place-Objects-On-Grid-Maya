# Place Objects on Home Grid inside Maya

A small script to place any object on the Home Grid inside Maya.
It takes the closest polygon to the homegrid and then calculates its middle point. 
Then it moves the object so that the point calculated aligns with the home grid plane (only in up down axis).
